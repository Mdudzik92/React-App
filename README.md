<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This is a simple Hangman app built with React and powered by JavaScript. The game allows the user to type in a limited number of letters to guess a specific word. If they guess 6 incorrect letters, a popup box alerts them that they have lost and gives them the option to play again. If they guess correct, a popup box lets them know they've won. Give it a try!
